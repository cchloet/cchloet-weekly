#### The search for FOSS project
The project "Tsunagari" (_at: https://github.com/TsunagariEngine/Tsunagari/find/master_) was the first thing I clicked because the description claimed to be open source
and the concept sounded very interesting and possibly beginner friendly. I immediately chose not to look more into it once I saw there was
no Code of Conduct file

I next looked into SelfReliance (_at: https://github.com/MohaElder/SelfReliance_), because the concept of a sex education video game seemed 
amusing and fun to work on. Although the license is MIT, there is no Code of Conduct, so the project was also immediately taken off my list of 
possibilities.

I am performing my search on github, and I feel like I am not doing it in a smart way. I typed topics that sounded general and interesting into
the search bar (_like "video game" "beginners"_) and narrowed the searches by only looking at repositories mainly in C++. I feel this way is 
likely very inefficient, but I'm not sure how to search for a FOSS project quicker. I sadly stopped my search here.

#### FOSS outside of the classroom
This week the only thing I did relating to FOSS is encourage a student in the Dolciani Science center in hunter college to look into 
FOSS projects. The student had never heard of FOSS as a concept, and became very interested upon hearing that Mozilla is a FOSS project. But other
than that, I've done nothing.
