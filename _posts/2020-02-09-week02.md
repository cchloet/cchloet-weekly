#### My take on FOSS project contribution
I would like to contribute to an open source project by:  
1. Submitting functions to optimize the project -- _Whether by reducing runtime or making the code readable_
2. Adding comments to explain what parts of the code do
3. Proofreading documents to check for spelling errors
4. Submitting ideas or concepts I would like to see added onto a project

By contributing to a FOSS (_Free and Open Source Software_) I will be able to see what it’ll be like to work on a group project in an atmosphere, _which I assume_,  is similar to a work environment. I will also be able to learn from other people’s code. I could possibly obtain new coding techniques to achieve specific outcomes. But above all, contributing to a FOSS project allows me to expand my portfolio, so on job interviews I will have something to show my capabilities.

Talking to classmates and teachers about school projects is **completely** different from discussing issues in a professional environment, so it is completely something I’ve got to improve on.

I’m not sure how contributing to a FOSS project on GitHub would improve my personal network, unless I become well known and well reputed. But I’m not sure how the social part of GitHub works (_and if there even **is** a social part of GitHub_).
