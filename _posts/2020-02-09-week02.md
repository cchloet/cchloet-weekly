#### My take on FOSS project contribution
I would like to contribute to an open source project by:  
1. Submitting functions to optimize the project -- _Whether by reducing runtime or making the code readable_
2. Adding comments to explain what parts of the code do
3. Proofreading documents
4. Submitting ideas or concepts I would like to see added onto a project

By contributing to a FOSS (_Free and Open Source Software_) project, I will be able to work on a group project in an atmosphere, _which I assume_, is similar to a work environment. I will also be able to learn from other people’s code. I will obtain knowledge of new coding techniques. Above all, I will expand my portfolio, which will allow me to showcase my skills during job interviews.

 Discussions in a classroom environment differ significantly from those in a professional environment. I also hope contributing to FOSS will improve my professional development.

I’m not sure how contributing to a FOSS project on GitHub would improve my personal network, unless I become well-known. But I’m not sure how the social part of GitHub works (_and if there even **is** a social part of GitHub_).
