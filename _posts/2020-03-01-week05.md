### In class project evaluation
---
This week as both class work and homework, Maite and I worked on a project evaluation for blockly, a google based FOSS project. The 
evaluation was very informative and interesting to do. I feel like I've started to understand what actually goes into contributing 
in one of these projects, just from examining how others do so. I did find it **extremely** difficult to answer questions regarding 
files that were not found in the repository, or answers which are not explictly shown in the files. Looking for those answers took an 
_unreasonable_ amount of time, because if I can't find a file, I assume I've magically lost the ability to read and I **must** recheck 
every file, _because why would a file I want to see **not** be found in the repository_. I would definitely say that finding the files I 
need to look at was the most difficult task for me. But on the other hand, that is a way for me to contribute to this project, even if
all of the code is written in javascript (_a coding language I've only had the briefest of introductions with_). By exploring their codes, 
I may be able to expand on the contributing document, or create a directory document, to help "directionally challenged" individuals like
me find specific file locations.

### What I'd be possibly interested in working on
